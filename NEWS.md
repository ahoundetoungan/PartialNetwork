# Version 1.0.0
First release

# Changes in Version 1.0.1
- As shown in the paper, we propose a simulated general method of moments (SGMM) for the SAR model (see function smmSAR and Section 2 of our vignette).
- We can now estimate the maximal bias of the instrumental variable estimator (see Section 1.1 and 1.2 of our vignette).

# Changes in Version 1.0.2
- We provide a smoother simulator of adjacency matrices in the SGMM approach.
- We add weights to the probit and logit network formation model.
